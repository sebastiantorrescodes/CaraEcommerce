Front End Code for an Ecommerce Website while following a tutorial from @tech2etc 

I decided to follow through with a 6 part video course from tech2etc to practice my skills in html, css, and javascript. It was a very informative course as I was interested in building my own eCommerce website and having it implement Stripe services. I hope to learn how to use a framework like React to create my Website.
